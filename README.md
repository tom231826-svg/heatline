# Heatline

**Open-source AI heat-health early warning and advisory — built for Jamaica, designed for replication across Caribbean SIDS and other LDCs/SIDS.**

## The problem

Extreme heat is one of Jamaica's clearest climate-health hazards. In 2024,
people in Jamaica were exposed to 48 heatwave days on average, 47 of which the
Lancet Countdown country data attributes to climate change; the Ministry of
Health and Wellness has warned that excessive heat stress can be "potentially
fatal." Jamaica has weather alerts, health advisories and regional
climate-health bulletins, but vulnerable residents still lack a last-mile,
personalized heat-health advisory and surveillance channel.

Heatline fills that gap.

## What it does

```
Open-Meteo forecast → heat-index (NOAA) → alert-window detection
   → audience-specific message (template, optionally AI-personalised)
   → WhatsApp / SMS / Messenger / bulletin   +   two-way Q&A
```

1. **Monitors** 7-day forecasts for every configured location and computes the
   NOAA heat index for every hour.
2. **Detects** dangerous heat-stress windows using configurable, sustained-heat
   thresholds (brief spikes don't page anyone; an at-most-one-alert-per-day cap
   prevents alert fatigue).
3. **Composes** plain-language protective guidance tailored to each audience —
   outdoor workers, older adults' caregivers, people with chronic illness,
   community health aides, and the general public — with optional AI
   personalisation and voice-note scripts for low-literacy and elderly users.
4. **Delivers** through Jamaica's dominant channel (WhatsApp) plus SMS and
   Messenger, and publishes a public daily bulletin.
5. **Answers** two-way questions a broadcast can't — *"My mother has
   hypertension; is tomorrow safe for the market?"* — grounded in the actual
   forecast and reviewed guidance.

### The megaphone model

Health chatbots succeed when **trusted institutions amplify them**, not as
direct-to-consumer apps. Heatline is built for that: alongside individual
opt-in subscribers, **community health aides, Red Cross volunteers and
community/church leaders** receive ward-level briefings formatted for onward
relay (the `community_health_aide` playbook + the `jsonl` export channel), and
**family caregivers** are prompted to check on elderly relatives — the
most heat-vulnerable, least-connected group.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tom231826-svg/heatline.git
cd heatline
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# 1. Validate the Jamaica configuration and playbooks (no network)
heatline check

# 2. Run against LIVE Jamaica forecasts and publish a bulletin
heatline run --channels console

# 3. See the full alert path on an illustrative heat-wave scenario
heatline run --fixture examples/illustrative_heat_event.json \
             --channels console,jsonl --now 2026-06-13T06:00

# 4. Ask a question (needs an AI key — see "AI backends")
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
heatline ask --location Kingston "I work construction. Is tomorrow safe?"
```

`heatline run` with no dangerous heat in the forecast produces a calm "no
alert" bulletin — which is the correct, honest output most days. Use the
illustrative fixture to exercise the alert path on demand.

## AI backends (swappable, optional)

Heatline **never requires** an LLM. With no key configured it uses static
playbook templates grounded in public guidance, so delivery is never blocked by a
missing key or a provider outage. To enable AI personalisation with GPT-6 Luna,
set `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | use OpenAI (default model `gpt-6-luna`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | optional legacy backend, only with `HEATLINE_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` |
| `HEATLINE_LLM_PROVIDER` | force `anthropic`, `openai`, or `none` |
| `HEATLINE_LLM_MODEL` | override the model id |

The default is OpenAI with `reasoning_effort=none` for Luna and a bounded
`max_completion_tokens` output budget. Anthropic is never selected automatically,
even when its key is present. No OpenAI key means template-only operation unless
a provider is explicitly selected. Clear any old `HEATLINE_LLM_PROVIDER` or
`HEATLINE_LLM_MODEL` overrides to use the new default. See the
[Luna API documentation](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6-luna).

Then add `--llm` to `heatline run`. The model is constrained to the reviewed
facts and is instructed never to invent medical content; any failure falls back
to the template (see [docs/safety.md](docs/safety.md)).

## Adapting to another country

Everything country-specific lives in **one file**. Copy
[`config/jamaica.yaml`](config/jamaica.yaml), change the locations, thresholds,
language, channels and emergency numbers, and run. No code changes. See
[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest --cov=heatline        # 60+ tests, ~90% coverage, no network required
